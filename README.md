## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Vermilion is an Artificial Intelligence that uses Sentiment Analysis as its primary feature. Vermilion is used just like any other AI all the while having unrestricted data. It also uses ML to further expand its coverage for detecting user inputs.

Note: Vermilion is **not** an open source project. It's source code will not be public and this applies to all the MaxTac projects.

## Built With

- Environment:

        Node.js v21.3.0

## Usage

Returns unrestricted data without limiting any of its access. This is also used to improve and enhance the quality of [Alexandrite](https://github.com/theoneandonlyshadow/Alexandrite-Magnus/) and [Shadow](https://github.com/theoneandonlyshado/Maximus-Shadow/) to provide better and understandable responses.

With the powerful features of Sentiment Analysis, MaxTac is able to understand the user's emotions and responses are sent accordingly.

**Please note that MaxTac or any of my projects do not share/reveal/track or store user's data in any way. I have full control in all of my projects including MaxTac.**

## Roadmap

See the <b>[MaxTac](https://madhavdotjs.netlify.app/public/maxtac) official page</b> for additional information.

## License

This is a <u>Closed Source Project</u>. Henceforth, source code will not be public. Please read why below.

## Important

This is a closed source project. Source code will not be public. It is done so to protect the integrity of MaxTac without the fear of getting stolen or improvised and avoid reselling without any credit for the actual author (me).

However, dependencies and installation process will be shared in some time to recreate the project on your own.
